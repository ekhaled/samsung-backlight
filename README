## Installation

git clone https://xonatius@github.com/xonatius/samsung-backlight.git
cd samsung-backlight
make
sudo make install

On some os you need to add samsung_backlight module to modules list. (f.e /etc/modules) After reboot it should work.

## Other samsung laptop models

If you've got samsung laptop with intel graphics card and it hasn't supported backlight control, you could create an issue with "lspci -nn" and "dmidecode -s system-product-name
" information.
